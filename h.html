<h2>DANCE</h2>
<font size="5">Dancing is one of my best habit, it is also my talent especially in the genre of hip hop. I learned dancing  when I was in 5th grade because on that day the school had an activity called NDEA then I try to join, After until then dancing became my habit, I love to move with my whole body and feel the rythm of the music.
